# Changelog

## [v0.0.3] - 2025-03-29

### Features âœ¨

1. **Multi-Directory Support:**
   The tool now accepts multiple directory paths as positional arguments.
   `content <command> [dir1] [dir2] ... [flags]`

- `.ignore` and `.gitignore` files are loaded relative to *each* specified directory.
- The `-e`/`--e` exclusion flag applies to direct children within *any* of the specified directories.
- Output for `tree` shows separate trees for each directory.
- Output for `content` concatenates file contents from all specified directories sequentially.
- Duplicate input directories (after resolving paths) are processed only once.
- If no directories are specified, it defaults to the current directory (`.`).

## [v0.0.2] - 2025-03-23

### What's New ðŸŽ‰

1. **Using `.ignore` Instead of `.ignore`:**  
   The tool now looks for a file named **.ignore** for exclusion patterns.

2. **Processing `.gitignore` by Default:**  
   The tool loads **.gitignore** by default if present. Use the `--no-gitignore` flag to disable this.

3. **Folder Exclusion Flags:**  
   Both **-e** and **--e** flags now work for specifying an exclusion folder. The folder is excluded only when it
   appears as a direct child of the working directory.

4. **Disabling Ignore File Logic:**
    - **--no-gitignore:** Prevents the tool from reading the **.gitignore** file.
    - **--no-ignore:** Prevents the tool from reading the **.ignore** file.

5. **Command Abbreviations:**  
   Short forms **t** for **tree** and **c** for **content** are now supported.
